We are not very accustomed to this kind of restaurant, and they helped us pick items and the right wine. Steaks were perfectly cooked. Sides were phenomenal. The cheesecake is to die for. Highly recommend for a special night out.\n",

      "Trendy and chic, incredibly decadent and lavish. Great place to celebrate a special occasion. Of course amazing steaks as you’d expect. The ceviche was amazing, and the cheesecake dessert was a work of art! Amazing cocktail options and incredible variety of bourbon. Lots of rare options that you can’t find elsewhere.\n",

      "Fantastic Steak and Seafood Restaurant. Service was impeccable, food was outstanding. Drinks and wine were top notch. One of the best restaurants in Toronto. It's a hidden gem in the city. Minutes away from Scotiabank Arena at Bay and Harbour Streets. Great for business meetings, date nights or out with friends. They have an outdoor patio too and a private diningroom. Make reservations ahead of time.\n",
