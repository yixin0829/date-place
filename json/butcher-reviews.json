The wine list is extensive and has some excellent options, whatever your pallette. Steaks were perfectly cooked (of course) and again had lots of choice. Sides perfectly balanced - highly recommend the brussel sprouts. Tableside banana foster and a delightful cheesecake was the perfect way to end the meal. Service was impeccable, exactly what one would expect of a 5-star restaurant. Atmosphere is high end and private. Lovely decor, beautiful blues and golds, makes for an overall perfect experience.",

Then we went with a 16oz Striploin AA&CO Queensland with 4oz of Wagyu from Miyazaki, Japan as well as 4oz of Kobe with everything being cooked to med-rare perfection.

The food was absolutely outstanding and the venue is intimate. Having experienced some other popular steakhouses of similar caliber in the city (Harbour 60, Blueblood), I can honestly say this was the best steakhouse meal I have ever had in Toronto. For a special occasion, the prices are absolutely worth it. To start, my partner and I ordered the bread, wild shrimp ceviche and caesar salad. The bread was brioche served with some kind of zucchini mixture on top and freshly shaved truffle. I really appreciated that they elevated the experience of having bread with a meal. It was really like it\u2019s own special appetizer. The Caesar salad was very good, although it was the wild shrimp ceviche that really blew me away. The flavour was complex and evolved as it was in your mouth. Hard to explain\u2026 but truly outstanding! For our main, we ordered the wild mushrooms, pastrami carrots, 8oz. PEI Tenderloin and Ontario 16 oz. Bone-in Striploin. My partner and I were blown away by the tenderness and flavour of the steaks. My PEI tenderloin had a wonderful salinity and a perfectly executed crust. The dinner for 2 was about $500. Although pricey, it was worth it. Cannot recommend this place enough! So impressed. It is obviously a lot of care has gone into the curation of the experience for the guest. We will definitely be back.",

I got the feeling it was a bit fancy, but when the hostess said \u201cdo you want to see a menu first, or are you comfortable\u201d, I was sure it was fancy and a little bit concerned about my wallet. Nonetheless, the t-bone steak was fantastic, and the cheese cake was memorable. The service was really top-notch. The sommelier was on hand to help with the wine selection, and our server knew everything about the beef they were serving. Turns out they have a pretty thick handbook (with pictures) of everything about the beef they serve. They are serious about their meat. The cheesecake was no everyday cheesecake, either. This cheesecake had extra flair. It comes to your table with smoking cold nitrogen. For a walk-in, it was a really amazing experience and totally worth it.",

I tried the miyazaki striploin medium and l really liked it. I think medium rare would have been good too. I didn't see too many sides/appetizers that I liked and the soup tasted ok but I didn't enjoy it...too runny for me. The dessert (pavlova) was ok a bit stale. I would just order steak and cocktails. They do also have a big wine list. Our server was nice however I did encountered unnecessary drama as soon as I entered. I booked this venue on Sept 14 for Oct 16th on OpenTable for 2 females and provided my credit card info and choose Birthday as the occasion. There were 2 radio buttons: one for indoor dining and another for outdoor which was grayed out (disabled). I obviously chose indoor dining. We arrived on time (6:30) and the hostess informed us that they only have patio seating available. It was a chilly day and raining too. I asked why and she told me because I hadn't booked it in advance and was a last minute booking. I told her I booked it about a month ago. She then said, I had to write my seating preference in the comment box. I felt I was being lied to and disrespected. She talked to her manager and we eventually had our indoor seat but told us we have to leave by 8 which made me feel very uncomfortable since ordering apps/main/dessert can sometimes take longer depending on the kitchen. This was my birthday and I didn't feel welcomed and didn't sense hospitality. When I told my sever he offered a complimentary martini and cheesecake. I appreciate the gesture but felt that the manager was arrogant and that impacts the overall vibe and service. I wish I had a better experience because I do love a good cocktail and steak.",

There are servers walking around and just ignored me. After we sit down for 10 minutes, there was no one came to us for water or even a hello. So my wife was sitting there for 25 minutes, without any water or anything. Finally, I did a big wave, and this guy noticed me. The chef was walking around here and there greeting other people like we were transparent. There were also other two gentle men dressing in suite and walked around here and there. I did not know what they were doing. Give me some water at least. My wife said to me, I guess other guests were more important than us. That was not cool.... Finally we decided to try the tasting menu. Without even told us what would be on the menu, he just told me that the tasting menu is expensive, like I could not afford it..... I smiled at him.....really I wanted to slap on his face and show him how much tax I paid last year. Terrible experience for the first half an hour. The food, I have got to be honest, they were amazing. Beautifully presented and prepared. I got the bill and added 15% tips for the food and the girl who actually \"served\" us. She was the only person nice to us. We left our table walked through the patio to the exit door. No one said thank you/bye/have a good night...

Personally one of the only restaurants I come to for steak because of the consistency. Regularly juicy, flavoursome, and cooked exactly as requested. Management is friendly, servers are timely, and the atmosphere is divine. 0 complaints. Can\u2019t forget the amazing mixology knowledge of the bartenders. Their ability to create new cocktails based on your likings or cravings is impressive.",

It\u2019s a unique and beautiful boutique steakhouse, hidden away on Harbour St. love that the entire family is involved, from the design and decor to the front of house staff, it speaks to their commitment and passion. The restaurant seats approximately 50, and it\u2019s an intimate experience. They have a unique cocktail menu, and I tried their version of the Sazerac which was accompanied by Absinthe meant to be sipped together. Very unique!! Our amusebouche consisted of a gug\u00e8re and potato crisp with shellfish - A great way to start off!! Their menu has great options for all, with seafood steak and game meats. Thank you to the staff for asking about and accommodating for food allergies ! Other stellar dishes pictured here are the octopus with chorizo and the succulent Venison - Wow that\u2019s probably the best venison I\u2019ve ever had! You have to try the smoked # carrots and shishito peppers - The smoke and spices definitely take these dishes to the next level! My dinner companions had the heirloom salad and Cornish Hen which were beautifully presented and delicious, as well as the steak which was \u2018perfectly done.\u2019 Our portion sizes were quite substantial so although we didn\u2019t stay for dessert, of course I took some to go. The white chocolate cheesecake was beautifully presented, delicious, and a wonderful end to the meal! Overall, an exceptional experience, and one I\u2019ve been waiting to try for years. The wait was worth it! Great job by this team overall and I wish you success on this journey!! I\u2019ll be back!",

For 350 dollars a person, you would expect high quality dishes with lots of taste and flavour. Unfortunately, this did not deliver at all. The lobster and carpaccio dish tasted extremely fishy. The next dish was an asparagus dish. This was under cooked / not seasoned at all. When describing the tasting menu, they told us it would come with two steak dishes. A waygu shortrib and a wagyu steak/ mushroom dish. Come to find out that they did not have the shortrib and instead we would get a veal dish. The veal was so fatty and tough, I could not finish it. The waygu and mushroom dish was room temperature when we received it, not hot at all. For a steak restaurant, I hoped that that would be the star of the tasting menu but both plates were just not done well. To walk out of a restaurant and spend 1,000 dollars to have cold steak is just not acceptable.",

Ignoring the fact that our entrees were taking forever and have yet to come out, why is someone who isn\u2019t even our server asking if we were ready to pay..? The same person held us back on our way out, informed us that there was a dress code and we should come dressed better next time. I hate to say it, you guys picked a location that\u2019s literally the first floor of a residential building, 30 yards from a subway sandwiches and maybe 50 yards from the ramp homeless people live under. Plus if I\u2019m spending half a grand on a meal, I\u2019ll wear a t-shirt and joggers if I want to.

We shared a magnificent Argentinian dry aged ribeye steak cooked medium rare to perfection. The accompanying oyster mushrooms and heirloom salad were outstanding. Although expensive, it is worth the money. My only criticism is there could be better signage identifying the restaurant so that it is easier to find.",

We had several different kind of steaks (family of 6) cooked to our perfect temperature preference. The seasoning was impeccably on point. We had several different sides, all of which were absolutely incredible. There's nothing worse than being in the mood for steak and not being happy with your order (Sadly I've experienced this many times at other restaurants). This place did not dissappoint & is a must try for any steak lover. We are looking forward to sampling more....the bbq box on the menu sounds perfect for our patio staycation this weekend!",

We've dined at Michael's On Simcoe numerous times and have always had an amazing experience so we were anticipating another wonderful evening. The Butcher Chef, did not disappoint. It's a intimate yet approachable setting with luxury finishes throughout; no detail was overlooked. The menu is concise and well thought with a comprehensive wine list with options for everyone. We were offered the bread coarse by the knowledgeable and friendly staff; it's an absolute must have! It's brioche loaf, the manager or wait staff will elegantly pour melted gruyere cheese on the top and finish it with a zest of cured meat. It's to die for. Enjoy. For our appetizers, we had the Heirloom Salad and Tuna & A5 Wagyu Tartare; both dishes we're prepared nicely and we're delicious. Would definitely recommend the Tartare. For our entrees, we split the San-Luis Argentina 14oz Ribeye. The waiter was very helpful throughout the evening, helping us navigate the menu and choices. When it came to Steaks, he was extremely valuable. He knew his cuts and regions well to help ensure we made the best decision for our palates. Sides, Shishito Peppers with Spiced Goat Cheese & Pastrami Smoked Carrots. We typically don't go for Carrots at restaurants but they were worth the \"gamble\". Very good and would recommend you try them. Desert, we had Salted Caramel Creme Brulee which was delicious. I would highly recommend The Butcher Chef for any occasion; it's a place to celebrate a special occasion or to catch up with friends / family.",
