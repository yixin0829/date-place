Our server, Eva M was awesome. Very attentive and super friendly. Nailed everything and still kept coming back to check on us even as the restaurant started to fill at an alarming rate. What a great way to start an evening that ended with Genesis on a big stage. We will be back for sure. If you get a chance to book a table beside the huge fireplace, do it. So cozy.",

The place is one with the more modern decor with a great space in both bar and dining room. We were quickly seated in the dining room after confirming our reservations. The waiter was nice and accommodating with recommendations. He brought us our drinks as well as bread before we ordered our mains. All of us received our meals about the same time but mine came out to be rare instead of blue. Although I had trouble finding our waiter, he quickly resolved the issue but taking my steak and told me that the kitchen will make it right. He kept the sides so I could munch on but took my fork where i had to grab a new set from the empty table next to us. When the new steak finally came, it was cooked right plus all the sides including the shrimp and scallop that was part of my order. To my surprise, the manager was the one who served my new plate as well as mentioned that my meal would not be on the bill as I had to eat alone since my group finished their meal waiting for me. It was a great gesture that was unexpected. Glad to have this experience as the steaks are reasonably priced for the quality of food and service.",

The prime rib was one of the best I have ever had! My wife really enjoyed the chicken, too. We splurged and got dessert since we're visiting on vacation. We split the fudge brownie Sunday.

This downtown location was busy and there was a 10 minute wait for the dining room. We chose to seat in the bar because we're running late. My beverage of choice tonight is the house Polar Ice Vodka Keg-size for $10.50. It's traditional Keg decor of dark rich colours and low lighting. The music level was average and conversation level was high. Still, it's a nice place and I'll come back for dinner in the future.",

The plan was to do a little shopping stay in a nice hotel and hit up the keg (our go to date night spot at home). We've never had a bad experience but we've never had an outstanding experience like this. The doormen were extremely friendly, even standing outside in the rain only to hold the door as we walked in, great big smiles (finally after 2 years of being masked it was amazing to see) the hostess seated us promptly, again with a great big smile. The server was incredibly personable, so sweet, talkative and accomodating. It was such a team effort to ensure we were taken care of as the team was so well staffed we had two servers and were checked up on by 2 different managers aswell. My husbands fav fruit is the cherry, so when he realized there was some kind of very different cherry that garnished his whiskey sour, he asked our server what it was, and really topped up BOTH of our next several drinks with these cherries! THEN, to our suprise, we finished our meals and drinks and (my personal fav desert) billy marner pie was dropped off at our table with a happy anniversary card without being asked, prompted nor expected. Best of all, after the 2 hours of dining (and chit chatting) we never once felt pushed to leave so they could fill the table with the next patrons. As parents of 4 children, we get a weekend away once in a VERY blue moon, so the time to sit, chat, enjoy drinks and a nice meal together and just a couple was so needed and so appreciated. The team could have easily brought the cheque in a passive aggressive \"your meal is done, now leave\" manner and yet never once did we feel that, nor did we abuse it ofcoarse, but it was these small touches that let us reconnect, relax and enjoy a very rare dinner for 2. Thank you Keg King Street!",

I knew that I was not overly hungry and would likely be asking for a take away bag. However, when the dinners arrived, there was a clear size and thickness difference between my 10 oz. Prime Rib and that 10 oz. of my friends. Although i knew the size was more then satisfactory for my immediate hunger needs, i mentioned the difference in size to our server. To her credit within five minutes, the chef was out with a more then adequate make up cut to minimize the difference between the two.

We chose Toronto as our first destination and on our first night together we walked down King st. Most kitchens were near closing time and The Keg accepted us in while the kitchen was still open. From the minute we arrived, we were rushed. I had to use the restroom and by the time I came out I was rushed to place an order. We sat inside and ordered 2 salmon dinner plates. About half an hour later the waitress came out with 1 plate. She mistakenly thought we ordered 1 plate instead of 2, because she was so rushed to take our order. We left hungry and dissatisfied. The Keg will remain our first date spot, but unfortunately won't be repeated.",

It was cold food, and my stake was cooked well done when I asked for medium. The other meal was suppose to be vegetarian, but came with bacon bits. Not sure if the manager/ chef wasn't working that day, but what a horrible experience. I recommend other keg locations, but definitely not this one. \ud83d\udc4e",

I have dietary restrictions and allergies and he made sure my needs were met. Unfortunately during our time at the patio there was a downpour and ultimately all guests had to be redirected back in. As this was mother nature's doing, we had no concerns, can't predict the weather. But this brings me to our encounter with the evening manager Chad - what a great manager and human being. Once we were relocated, Chad came to our table to make sure our dinner needs were met - all was fine. But he went above and beyond when it came time to pay our bill. It was a very busy evening at The Keg and I am sure the kitchen was working hard to have meals out in a timely fashion. Chad took the extra step and took care of our apps and offered us dessert. We declined the dessert so he offered dessert to go. We were so taken aback as we haven't experienced such great customer service ever! He made us feel real good about our experience and made sure we were taken care of. All managers/staff to be should be trained by Chad as he knows how to provide exceptional customer service. We would like to extend our gratitude out to Chad and the team of King West who clearly work really hard to make sure their customers walk away feeling real good. And food, delicious as always!

Our 2 orders of garlic shrimp were overcooked and shrimp tough, escargot were great, waited half hour after to get our steaks, 1 cooked perfect the other not so much. Sat without drinks and then when we did get a drink it was wrong, waited once again and finally after asking other wait staff our waitress showed up took the drink and then forgot to return with the correct cocktail until reminded. After the long waits and extremely inattentive waitress we didnt dare ask for his birthday cake and went elsewhere. Our waitress was given no tip as we did not feel she deserved and I can't see us returning to this location.

The manager came over and apologized. Thanks Scott. There is no bus boy/girl so when the main course came the salad plates where still on the table and we had to remove them so the hot food could be set down. Did I mention that we ordered filet mignon But the knife at the table was not a steak knife. Server or non existent bussers did not prep properly for the meal. Server brought said sharp steak knife after we asked for one. Presentation was beautiful.

My wife starter with French onion soup, Cajun shrimp and sirloin finished with creme brule. Both meals were cooked perfectly and were delicious. Our server was friendly, polite and proficient.

In the downtown core of T.O, this not acceptable for 2020. But then again, the structure of the building has something to do with the poor signals. On the other hand, the Kegs wifi network was also pretty slow as well but somewhat acceptable, about 5Mbp/s download speeds...
